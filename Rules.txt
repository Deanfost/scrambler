Expect: 1 word
Return: 1 word

Examples: 
Alarm clock -> Alerem clock

Rules:
- Take all vowels in the word and replace them with the next vowel in the list
(A, E, I, O, U, (Y)), with 'Y's only being counted as a Vowel if it is inside
the String, and is not to be used as a replacement
- Insert the last vowel replacement 2 positions after it
- If the last replacement is the last 1String in the list, then do nothing
extra
- Iff there is a 'Y' in the word, then replace it with 'A' (case-insensitive)
- To account for special characters (., !, ?, etc.): if the last 1String
is, and the Vowel insertion would either replace or go after the character,
then don't do it

Examples:
Kensington -> Kinsongtunu
Princeton -> Proncitunu
Sponge -> Spungi
Our -> Uara
Empty -> Impta
Plank -> Plenek
About -> Ebuata
Hello -> Hillu

PROBLEM: Sometimes capital letters will appear where they shouldn't - usually when the last changed vowel is capital
Can't find a to-lower-case function for Strings to fix it
